# Introduction 
This project started as an assignment for my Software Engineering class in college, but it was a fun undertaking so I still work on improving it from time to time
# Goal
To create an application that allows Players and Tournament Organizers for Esports events to view, create, and register for tournaments all in one location. Obviously apps similar to this exist, so this for me is simply a way to learn.
